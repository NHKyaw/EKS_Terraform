🚀 Introducing my new project: EKS VPC setup with Terraform 🌐

This repository contains a Terraform configuration for creating a custom VPC tailored for hosting an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. It demonstrates a clean, modular, and reusable approach to managing cloud infrastructure as code.

What this project covers:
VPC Configuration: Secure and isolated networking for EKS.
Subnets: Private and public subnets designed for EKS workloads.
Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway: Ensuring outbound connectivity for private subnets.
Route Tables: Proper routing configuration for optimal networking.
Scalability and Modularity: Easily extendable for new cloud resources.
🔧 Technologies Used:
Terraform: Automating the cloud infrastructure.
AWS: Leveraging scalable and secure cloud services.
💡 Why this matters:
EKS simplifies Kubernetes management, but setting up the networking stack is crucial.
This repository showcases how to use Terraform for robust and automated cloud setups, a vital skill in modern DevOps practices.
